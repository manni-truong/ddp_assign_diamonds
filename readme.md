# Diamond Price Predictor

## Introduction

This shiny app was built as part of Coursera's Developing Data Products course. The app uses the `diamonds` dataset which is part of `ggplot2`. We use linear modelling to build a model that can be used to predict the price of a diamond given certain characteristics, such as carat. 

## App

The app can be accessed at [shinyapps](https://mhtruong.shinyapps.io/assignment/).

## Pitch presentation

The accompanying pitch presentation is found at [gh-pages](http://manni-truong.github.io/ddp_assign_diamonds/pitch-presentation-rpubs.html).
